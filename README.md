This repository is in correspondence with the recent research work on application of mathematical functions in the artificial intelligence in terms of improving respective learning rate and convergence rate.
The corresponding paper appeared in MDPI-Mathematics as a feature paper for my significant contribution in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. This paper can now be access on https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/12/6/829.
